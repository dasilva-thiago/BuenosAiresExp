# Buenos Aires Explorer
 
A desktop application built with C# and Windows Forms for organizing points of interest in Buenos Aires, with support for location registration, automatic coordinate lookup, distance calculation, and visit route planning.
 
> This project is under active development. Features and structure may change.

## Motivation

This project was created to explore desktop application development with C# and WinForms, 
focusing on clean architecture, UI customization, and integration with external services 
such as geocoding and map rendering. The main objective is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for users to plan their visits to Buenos Aires, 
allowing them to register locations, create itineraries, and visualize routes on a map, all in a single application.

## Database
 
The SQLite database (`buenos_aires.db`) is created automatically on first run via `Database.Migrate()`. The current schema includes three tables:
 
- **Locations** — points of interest (name, category, address, coordinates, notes)
- **Itineraries** — itineraries (name, date, notes)
- **ItineraryItems** — relationship between itineraries and locations, with visit order
